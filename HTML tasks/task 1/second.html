    <p><b>Lorem</b> Ispum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ispum has been the<br>
    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br>
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,but also the leap into<br>
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
